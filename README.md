## Abstract

Online petition such as ‘We the people’, ‘Change.org’ and ‘Blue House petition’ have become a new form of online democracy. Online petitions can be spread easily and rapidly through social media, online communities and news media. This specific characteristic can lower the barrier of public political participation, but also creates potential risk of ochlocracy. Considering the influence of online petition systems as a new emerging form of online democracy, they have been studied little by researchers. This motivated us to start a research prject about online petition system. As soon as we begin, we encountered a fundamental question, ‘Can we accept the number of asserters or signatures shown in the petition as public opinion?’. In this research, we answer this question by analyzing the relation between the media and the petition system using Big Data analysis. 

Among various online petition system, we selected ‘Blue House petition’. It is because 'Blue House petitioin' is one of the most active petition systems and it is also heavily influencing the South Korean society. We compared the tendency of frequency of news articles keywords, agree trend and tweets, and also compared difference in tendency of agree trend according to the emotions score of related news article comments. We were able to classify the petitions to Type N1, Type N2 based on the change of frequency of news articles keywords. We also classified the petitions by Type T1, Type T2 according to the change of tweets. Based on our classification, we discovered that there is a high correlation between the media and the petition system. And we also found out that online petition seems to have journalistic characteristics, since the online petitions create and deliver agendas. We concluded that it is hard to say that the number shown in the petition system is not exactly the same as public opinion. Also, we discovered that the higher the negative emotion, the more erratic the tweets trends tend to be.
